const inputText = `# We've added some examples to get you started...

## Here is another heading
### And a sub-heading

Here is some text with:
 **bold formatting**, _italic formatting_, **_bold and italic together_**,
And some text that has been ~~crossed out~~.

- This is an example list with several indents.
  - Example 1.
     - Example 2.
1. Or using numbers.
2. Example 1.
3. Example 2.

You can also add some inline code surrounded by backticks: \`<p></p>\`.

Or an entire block if the first and last lines are triple-backticks:

\`\`\`
// Example block of code:

function foo(bar) {
  return bar;
}
\`\`\`

This is how you would add a table:

 Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3
Row 2 Cell 1 | Row 2 Cell 2 | Row 2 Cell 3

And finally a block quote:
> Thanks for visiting!`;

export default inputText;
